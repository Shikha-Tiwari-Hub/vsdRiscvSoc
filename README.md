# vsdRiscvSoc
This repository documents my progress in the **VSD RISC-V SoC**

## OBJECTIVE
To successfully complete the initial task of the **VSD RISC-V SoC** by setting up a fully functional RISC-V environment using a prebuilt GCC toolchain, Spike ISA simulator, and Proxy Kernel. The goal is verified by executing a custom uniqueness test program on the simulated RISC-V platform.

## Environment Setup Instructions
# Step 1: Download Required Software
Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (Desktop)
ðŸ”—[Download ISO (64-bit)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/ubuntu-22.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso)  
Oracle VirtualBox (for running Ubuntu VM)
ðŸ”—[Download VirtualBox for Windows](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
# Step 2: Create a Virtual Machine in VirtualBox
After creating the VM, load the downloaded Ubuntu ISO as a startup disk and install Ubuntu normally inside the VM.
# Step 3: Ubuntu Setup (after installation)
* update Ubuntu Packages
* open Terminal (ctrl+alt+T)
* Run this command in your WSL terminal:
```sudo apt-get update```
-This makes sure your Ubuntu system is fresh and error-free before you begin Task-1.

## Task 1 â€” Install base developer tools 
These are common build prerequisites (compilers, linkers, autotools) and libraries 
required by the RISCâ€‘V simulator, proxy kernel, and other tooling. GTKWaves is included for 
waveform viewing in digital design flows. 
```sudo apt-get install -y git vim autoconf automake autotools-dev curl \ 
libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex \ 
texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat1-dev gtkwave```
